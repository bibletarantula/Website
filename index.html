<Magic><h1><center>Welcome to Project EPF Agent.</center></h1>

<body>
<center>Welcome to <b>Project EPF</b> | A new look to Subarctic Island 2 ❤️.</center>
<center><h1>What is Project EPF?</h1></center>
<center><p>Project EPF is going to be a HTML-5 Recreation of Subarctic Island<br>
Project EPF is going to have a new twist with new minigames, new dimensions to explore,<br>
and a new way to play Subarctic Island.</p>
<h1>Our plan</h1>
<p>Our plan of action is to use the Unity Engine to recreate the whole game (Besides the already<br>
existing assets so penguins, rooms, map -Will be Modified-, etc) and to recode the whole game in<br>
WebGL (Unity's Version of HTML-5).</p>
<h1>How to get involved with the project?</h1>
<p>Well there is a few ways, By donating to our <a href="https://www.patreon.com/subarcticisland2">Patreon</a> or server boosting the <a href="https://discord.gg/H62wWBwRMw">Discord Server</a><br>
You can also promote the project and give them the discord server link (https://discord.gg/H62wWBwRMw).</p>
<h1>FnQ</h1>
<p>Q: Will the project be open source in the future?<br>
A: Yes we are planning to open source the project in the future <3 <br>
Q: Is it going to have all the old minigames and map and everything else but some new stuff added in?<br>
A: Yes! We will be adding new content in the game!<br></p>
<h1>Current Developers/Designers</h1>
<p>We have only 2 people working on Project EPF at the moment and those are<br>
Gavin#3577 - Developer And Maintainer<br>
Vortyx#6969 - Creator, Developer, and Maintainer of Project EPF<br></p>
<h1>Release Plan</h1>
<p>Our Release plan is when we release it only 2 CPPS' will have access to the source code and server<br>
files. <a href="https://discord.gg/BPgtPtjg25">Waddlr</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/BPgtPtjg25">Subarctic Island (OWNERS OF PROJECT EPF)</a><br>
If people from a different discord server claim that they have Project EPF's Files they are false and will probably have some sort of malware<br>
or some other malicious things in the code. We recommend going to the servers above to get exclusive sneak peeks, dev downloads, and more<br>
We have notified Waddlr that they are not allowed to publish the Project EPF Source Code as it is against our ToS of using these files<br>
We will release the source code within 1-2 weeks of release to test out the server files and the source files incase of any<br>
issues that should get addressed.<br>
