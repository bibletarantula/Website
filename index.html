<center>Welcome to <b>Project EPF</b> | A new look to Subarctic Island 2 ❤️.</center>
<center><h1>What is Project EPF?</h1></center>
<center><p>Project EPF is going to be a HTML-5 Recreation of Subarctic Island<br>
Project EPF is going to have a new twist with new minigames, new dimensions to explore,<br>
and a new way to play Subarctic Island.</p>
<h1>Our plan</h1>
<p>Our plan of action is to use the Unity Engine to recreate the whole game (Besides the already<br>
existing assets so penguins, rooms, map -Will be Modified-, etc) and to recode the whole game in<br>
WebGL (Unity's Version of HTML-5).</p>
<h1>How to get involved with the project?</h1>

You can also promote the project and give them the discord server link (https://discord.gg/H62wWBwRMw).</p>
<h1>FnQ</h1>
<p>Q: Will the project be open source in the future?<br>
A: Yes we are planning to open source the project in the future <3 <br>
Q: Is it going to have all the old minigames and map and everything else but some new stuff added in?<br>
A: Yes! We will be adding new content in the game!<br></p>
